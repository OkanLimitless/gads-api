## Google Ads scripts (compliant)

These scripts create an ad group and a responsive search ad, then monitor policy approval and optionally update the ad's Final URL within the same domain.

Important: Do not attempt to bypass platform review. Always use landing pages you own and that comply with policies. URL updates, even within the same domain, may trigger re-review.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- `google-ads` credentials configured via `google-ads.yaml` (see Google Ads API docs)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure credentials
By default the client loads `~/.google-ads.yaml`. To use a custom path, set `GOOGLE_ADS_CONFIG_PATH` to your config file.

### Create ad group and ad
```bash
python3 scripts/create_ad_group_and_ad.py \
  --customer_id 1234567890 \
  --campaign_id 111222333 \
  --ad_group_name "Search - Brand" \
  --final_url "https://www.example.com" \
  --headline "Official Site" \
  --headline "Book Online" \
  --headline "24/7 Support" \
  --description "Find fares and deals today." \
  --description "Fast booking, secure checkout."
```
This writes created resource names to `data/created_ads.json`.

### Monitor approval and update Final URL (same-domain only)
```bash
python3 scripts/monitor_and_update_url.py \
  --customer_id 1234567890 \
  --new_url "https://www.example.com/landing" \
  --poll_interval_secs 60 \
  --timeout_secs 3600
```
- Cross-domain URL changes are not supported by this tool.

### Notes
- Always ensure your Final URLs are policy-compliant and owned/authorized by you.
- Updates use an update mask for `ad.final_urls` only, but platforms may still re-review the ad.
