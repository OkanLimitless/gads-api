# Troubleshooting Guide - AdGenius Creator

## White Screen Issue on Vercel

If you're seeing a white screen on your Vercel deployment, here are the steps to fix it:

### ✅ **Fixed Issues (Latest Version)**

The following issues have been resolved in the current version:

1. **Removed problematic dependencies** - Removed `tailwindcss-animate` that was causing build issues
2. **Added dynamic imports** - Components now load dynamically to prevent SSR issues
3. **Added mount checks** - Proper client-side rendering detection
4. **Fallback styles** - CSS fallbacks in case Tailwind doesn't load
5. **Simplified dependencies** - Cleaner package.json with only essential packages

### 🔧 **Steps to Deploy Successfully**

1. **Push the latest changes to your repository:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix white screen issue - simplified dependencies and added fallbacks"
git push origin main
```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Click on your project
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
   - OR: Push new changes to trigger automatic deployment

3. **Test the deployment:**
   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Try the test page: `your-url.vercel.app/test`
   - Then go back to the main page: `your-url.vercel.app/`

### 🧪 **Testing Your Deployment**

1. **Test Page**: Visit `/test` to verify basic Next.js functionality
2. **Main Page**: Visit `/` for the full AdGenius Creator dashboard
3. **API Routes**: Check if `/api/campaigns` returns JSON data

### 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### Issue: Still seeing white screen
**Solution**: 
- Check Vercel build logs for errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Try the `/test` page first to verify basic functionality

#### Issue: Components not loading
**Solution**: 
- The components now use dynamic imports
- They should load progressively
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Issue: Styling not working
**Solution**: 
- Fallback styles are included
- Basic styling should work even without Tailwind
- Check if CSS files are being served correctly

### 📊 **What Should Work Now**

✅ **Basic page rendering**
✅ **Test page at `/test`**
✅ **Main dashboard at `/`**
✅ **API routes (`/api/campaigns`, `/api/ad-groups`, `/api/keywords`)**
✅ **Mock data display**
✅ **Campaign creation forms**
✅ **Ad group management**
✅ **Keyword management**
✅ **Responsive design**

### 🚀 **Vercel Environment Variables**

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

```
GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=PhK1VZetIe4qsZh8y51Sug
```

(Other Google Ads variables are optional for the demo version)

### 📝 **Build Information**

- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.30
- **Build**: Static + Server-side rendering
- **Total bundle size**: ~103 kB (optimized)
- **API routes**: 3 endpoints
- **Pages**: 2 pages (main + test)

### 🆘 **If Problems Persist**

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard → Your project → Functions tab
   - Look for any runtime errors

2. **Browser Developer Tools:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Look at Network tab for failed requests

3. **Vercel Build Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard → Your project → Deployments
   - Click on a deployment to see build logs

4. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   - If it works locally but not on Vercel, it's a deployment issue

### ✉️ **Getting Help**

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the test page** (`/test`) - if this works, the main app should too
2. **Look at Vercel build logs** for specific error messages
3. **Check browser console** for client-side errors
4. **Verify environment variables** are set in Vercel dashboard

The application is now much more robust and should deploy successfully to Vercel! 🎉
